**Q: I has many separate tables that need to be combined into a single file?**

google search "R read many datasets or tables"

# **Three steps**:
  1. Getting a list of files path to read
  2. Write a function to read a file 
  3. Then loop it
<br>

## step01: list all files path
```{r }
library(here) 
allfiles = list.files(path = here("data"), #Use the ⭐here package to indicate the directory the files are in relative to the root directory
                        pattern = "AB.csv|ab.csv",#tell R which file paths should be listed
                        full.names = TRUE,
                        recursive = TRUE) #indicate whether or not child folders in the parent directory should be searched for files to list or not
```


## step02: write a function to read a single file
```{r}
library(stringr)

#eg_path: data/Block1/Siteone/SIT1_17_12_21_5.2_AB.csv
read_fun = function(path) {
     test = read.csv(path, 
                skip = 6,
                header = FALSE,
                col.names = c("date", "temperature") )
     allnames = str_split( path, pattern = "/", simplify = TRUE)
     test$block = allnames[, ncol(allnames) - 2] 
     test$site = allnames[, ncol(allnames) - 1] #The information on the physical units of the study, “Blocks” and “Sites”
     test$plot = str_extract(allnames[, ncol(allnames)], pattern = "[0-9](?=\\.)")
     test$logloc = toupper( str_sub(allnames[, ncol(allnames)], start = -6, end = -5) )
     test
}
```

step03: read all files

If using either of for or lapply, the final concatenation step can be done via rbind in do.call

`map_dfr` looks like, looping through each element of allfiles to read and modify the datasets with the read_fun function and then stacking everything together into a final combined dataset
```{r}
library(furrr)
library(future)
plan(multiprocess)
library(tictoc)
tic()
( combined_dat = future_map_dfr(allfiles, read_fun, .progress = TRUE) )
toc() 
```
